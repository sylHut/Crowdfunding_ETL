# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project includes four files.
(1) ETL_Mini_Project_SHutchison.ipynb file
(2) ERD_SHutchison file to create a database schema
(3) crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file that was exported from QuickDBD
(4) crowdfunding_db.sql file to run the tables in PostgreSQL

In addition, I'm providing four additional sql_table png files to show the tables ran successfully in PostgreSQL.
